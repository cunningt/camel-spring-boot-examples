= Camel Example Spring Boot JTA

This example demonstrates how to run a Camel Service on Spring Boot that supports JTA transactions on two external transactional resources: a database (MySQL) and a message broker (Artemis) together with a crash recovery.

We use Narayana as standalone JTA Transaction Manager implementation, and Hibernate as JPA Adapter.
Most of the configuration is automatically configured by Spring-Boot using AutoConfiguration and you can see the related properties in `application.properties` and `application-local.properties`/`application-openshift.properties`, depending on the environment you are using.

== Trying out the example on your local machine
=== External systems

Start MySQL:

----
WORK_DIR="$HOME/.local/mysql"
docker run --name db-mysql \
  -e MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=root \
  -v $WORK_DIR:/var/lib/mysql \
  -d -p 3306:3306 mysql
----

----
docker exec -it db-mysql mysql -uroot -proot -e \
  "CREATE DATABASE testdb CHARACTER SET utf8mb4;
   CREATE USER 'admin'@'%' IDENTIFIED WITH mysql_native_password BY 'admin';
   GRANT CREATE,SELECT,INSERT,UPDATE,DELETE ON testdb.* TO 'admin'@'%';
   GRANT XA_RECOVER_ADMIN on *.* to 'admin'@'%';
   FLUSH PRIVILEGES;"
----

----
docker exec -it db-mysql mysql testdb -uadmin -padmin -e \
  "CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS audit_log (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    message VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL
  );"
----

Start Artemis:

----
docker run --name artemis \
  -e AMQ_USER=admin \
  -e AMQ_PASSWORD=admin \
  -d -p 61616:61616 \
  quay.io/artemiscloud/activemq-artemis-broker
----

=== How to run

You can run this example using:

----
mvn clean spring-boot:run
----

Test the service endpoint from another terminal:

----
ADDRESS="http://localhost:8080/api"
curl -X POST $ADDRESS/messages/hello
curl $ADDRESS/messages
----

Two messages should appear in the database: `hello` and `hello-ok` that indicate that everything worked correctly.


Test rollback by calling the service with "fail" message:

----
curl -X POST $ADDRESS/messages/fail
----

You should not find any trace of the message when querying the messages.

Test the recovery by calling the service with "crash" message:

----
curl -X POST $ADDRESS/messages/crash
----

The `crash` message causes the application to crash before commiting the transaction, therefore after the process ends you won't see any message in the database.

You can examine the database table directly for example with following command:

----
docker exec -it db-mysql mysql testdb -uadmin -padmin -e "select * from audit_log;"
----

You can restart the application with `mvn spring-boot:run`.

----
IMPORTANT: Do not use maven "clean" goal in the next step, as the transaction manager logs are stored in "target" directory
----

After a short while the transaction recovery will happen and you will see the expected messages in the database.

The crash process is controller by two things:

- message has the word `crash` in the body
- marker file `target/crashed` doesn't exist

If you want to repeat the crash process, make sure the marker file does not exist.

== Trying out the example on OpenShift

Everything mentioned in previous chapter is also applicable when running the example on OpenShift.
On OpenShift the application is deployed as a `StatefulSet` with `2` replicas and you will be communicating only with the second pod (see `OpenShift Narayana recovery controller` section below for explanation).

This example uses a `PersistentVolume` as a shared storage between the multiple pods of the StatefulSet.
Depending on the OpenShift configuration, there may be changes needed to the link:src/main/jkube/statefulset.yml[statefulset.yml] file.

First, start with creating a new OpenShift project:

----
oc new-project csb-example
----

=== External systems

Create a new deployment for MySQL:

----
oc new-app mysql -e MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=root
----

When the pod is ready, create the necessary schema and user:

----
oc exec deployment/mysql -- mysql -uroot -e \
    "CREATE DATABASE testdb CHARACTER SET utf8mb4;
     CREATE USER 'admin'@'%' IDENTIFIED WITH mysql_native_password BY 'admin';
     GRANT CREATE,SELECT,INSERT,UPDATE,DELETE ON testdb.* TO 'admin'@'%';
     GRANT XA_RECOVER_ADMIN on *.* to 'admin'@'%';
     FLUSH PRIVILEGES;"
----

----
oc exec deployment/mysql -- mysql testdb -uadmin -padmin -e \
    "CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS audit_log (
         id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
         message VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL
     );"
----

Create a new deployment for Artemis:

----
oc new-app quay.io/artemiscloud/activemq-artemis-broker -e AMQ_USER=admin -e AMQ_PASSWORD=admin
----

Patch the default `activemq-artemis-broker` service to serve the `61616` port:

----
oc patch service/activemq-artemis-broker -p '{"spec":{"ports":[{"name":"61616-tcp", "port": 61616, "protocol": "TCP", "targetPort": 61616}]}}'
----

=== How to run

The application is deployed using the `openshift-maven-plugin` that takes care of creating all the necessary OpenShift resources.

Simply use the following command to deploy the application:

----
mvn clean package -Popenshift
----

After both application pods reach the `Ready` state, you can try the same steps as in the local machine deployment.

To get the address of the application use:

----
ADDRESS="http://$(oc get route spring-boot-jta-jpa-autoconfigure -o jsonpath='{.spec.host}')/api"
----

To view the database content:

----
oc exec deployment/mysql -- mysql testdb -uadmin -padmin -e "select * from audit_log;"
----

The shared storage that is mounted to the pods that is used to store the transaction manager logs is mounted as `/tmp/storage`.

You can remove the crash marker file with:

----
oc exec statefulset/spring-boot-jta-jpa-autoconfigure -- rm -f /tmp/storage/crashed
----

=== OpenShift Narayana recovery controller

One part of the narayana-spring-boot project is a special recovery controller that watches the configured OpenShift `StatefulSet` and guarantees that when the application is scaled down, all instances, that are terminated, complete all their work correctly without leaving pending transactions.
The scale-down operation is rolled back by the controller if the recovery manager is not been able to flush all pending work before terminating.
This special recovery controller always runs on the `first pod` of the StatefulSet (the pod with `-0` suffix).

You can simulate this behavior by sending the `crash` message, immediately followed by scaling down the statefulset:

----
curl -X POST $ADDRESS/messages/crash && oc scale statefulset spring-boot-jta-jpa-autoconfigure --replicas 1
----

After a while the recovery controller will scale the statefulset back to two replicas and the transaction is recovered and commited.

You can see in the logs of `spring-boot-jpa-jta-autoconfigure-0` the following messages:

----
WARN [scheduling-1] dev.snowdrop.boot.narayana.openshift.recovery.StatefulsetRecoveryController Pod spring-boot-jta-jpa-autoconfigure-1 has pending work and must be restored again
INFO [scheduling-1] dev.snowdrop.boot.narayana.openshift.recovery.StatefulsetRecoveryController Statefulset spring-boot-jta-jpa-autoconfigure successfully scaled to 2 replicas
----

After finishing its pending work the statefulset can be scaled down as usual.
